This project predicts retail business opportunities using geospatial and sensor data to help identify ideal locations with lower competition. Built with Python, Flask, and Folium, it combines sensor coordinates, business categories, and spatial analysis to score potential sites. The app visualizes sensor locations on an interactive map and lets users analyze opportunity levels for various business types by clicking on the map. It leverages libraries like GeoPandas and Geopy for geographic calculations and integrates data from OpenStreetMap. To run the project, install the required Python packages, place the provided datasets in the data folder, and start the Flask server. This tool aims to assist entrepreneurs and analysts in making data-driven decisions for retail expansion.
